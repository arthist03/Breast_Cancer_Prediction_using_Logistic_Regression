# Breast Cancer Prediction using Logistic Regression

## Overview
This project utilizes Logistic Regression to predict breast cancer likelihood based on relevant features.

## Dataset
The dataset used is sourced from Kaggle: [Breast Cancer Wisconsin Data](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data).

## Instructions for Kaggle API Setup
To access the dataset, provide your Kaggle username and key in the specified space.

## Usage
Open the project notebook in Jupyter or Colab to explore the dataset, train the model, and make predictions.

## Logistic Regression in Supervised Learning
Logistic Regression is effective for binary classification, predicting whether an instance belongs to one class (1) or another (0).
